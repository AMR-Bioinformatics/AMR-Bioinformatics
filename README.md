# Welcome-to-AMR-Genomics
Welcome to the antimicrobial resistance genomics page!

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global health problem that poses a serious threat to human and animal health. AMR occurs when microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites develop the ability to survive exposure to antimicrobial drugs, including antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals. This resistance can be acquired through genetic changes, such as mutations or the acquisition of resistance genes, which allow microorganisms to evade the action of these drugs.

The study of AMR genomics involves the use of genomic techniques, such as DNA sequencing and bioinformatics, to understand the genetic basis of antimicrobial resistance. This includes identifying the specific genes and mutations that contribute to resistance, as well as the mechanisms by which these genes and mutations allow microorganisms to survive exposure to antimicrobial drugs.

On this page, you will find resources and information related to the genomics of antimicrobial resistance, including:

* Overviews of the genetics and molecular mechanisms of AMR
* Lists of commonly studied AMR genes and mutations
* Tools and databases for analyzing AMR genomic data
* Case studies and examples of how AMR genomics has been used to understand and combat antimicrobial resistance

We hope that this page will serve as a valuable resource for those interested in AMR genomics and the fight against antimicrobial resistance.
